# election2016
State-by-state presidential election results, alongside population data from the 2010 census and electoral college makeup.

Read my [blog post](http://pushpullfork.com/2016/12/did-third-party-votes-lose-clinton-the-election/) describing the data and the code.

Data comes from the Associated Press and WikiPedia (see blog post for links). Only some states' results are official.
